Find the nearest smaller numbers on left side in an array
Last Updated : 24 Jul, 2022
Given an array of integers, find the nearest smaller number for every element such that the smaller element is on the left side.

Examples: 

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 4, 10, 2, 5}
Output:         {-1, 1, 1,  4, 1, 2}
First element ('1') has no element on left side. For 6, 
there is only one smaller element on left side '1'. 
For 10, there are three smaller elements on left side (1,
6 and 4), nearest among the three elements is 4.
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 0, 2, 5}
Output:        {-1, 1, -1, 0, 2}
Expected time complexity is O(n). 

A Simple Solution is to use two nested loops. The outer loop starts from the second element, the inner loop goes to all elements on the left side of the element picked by the outer loop and stops as soon as it finds a smaller element.
